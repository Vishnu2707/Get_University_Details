Hi There!!

Key Concept - API call using Python.

Requirements

# Do install requests library - python.

# Command to install is  - pip install requests.

# API call has been done and the input is given with the call so that the necessary data is fetched.

# The fetched data is then manaipulated according to the needs. I have commented in between the code for better understanding.

# The response that we get after the API fetch is in json format. Make sure to convert and utilize the data accordingly.
